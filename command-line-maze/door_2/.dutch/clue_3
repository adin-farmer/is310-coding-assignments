If the original transcription is indeed more accurate, the phrasing "ain't I a woman" admittedly isn't too far off. 
(Though it does lack some understanding of black american english at the time)

Which line comes before the line that inspires this mistranslation: "And ar'nt I a woman"?

line_1 = "Nobody eber helps me into carriages or ober mud-puddles, or gives me any best place."
line_2 = "Bleeged to ye for hearin’ on me, and now ole Sojourner ha’n’t got nothin’ more to say."
line_3 = "Look at me."
